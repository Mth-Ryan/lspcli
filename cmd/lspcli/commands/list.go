	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	listCmd.Flags().String("kind", "", "Show all tools for the specified kind")
	listCmd.Flags().String("lang", "", "Show all tools for the specified language")
	listCmd.Flags().Bool("installed", false, "Show only the installed tools")
	listCmd.Flags().BoolP("json", "j", false, "Send the output as a json object")
